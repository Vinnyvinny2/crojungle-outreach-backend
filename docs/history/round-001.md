# §1 — Nothing has a clock on it
Source: CLAUDE.md lines 206-243, moved verbatim 2026-09-02 from commit b01d952e4f95d7b69686bc2c4063ca2aa0cb7546 (branch backup/claude-md-monolith). Nothing below this line was edited.

## 1. Nothing has a clock on it

Every lead logs:

```
[LANE] no job-posting signal — there is NO measured buying window.
```

Thirty-plus leads, zero exceptions. 92.5% of discovery is Google Places.

**Correction, 2026-08-13.** This paragraph used to say Adzuna, BizBuySell, SEC
EDGAR and Google News "produce essentially nothing," and that was wrong about two
of them. It was written from the absence of the LANE line rather than from the
sources' own logs, which is the same mistake as reading a Firecrawl refusal as an
empty page — judging a source by a symptom downstream of it instead of by what it
actually returned.

- **SEC EDGAR works.** Live: `SEC EDGAR: 13 from 39 hits (investment funds
  filtered out)`. Thirteen operating companies per run. Low volume and the high
  end of the ICP — a Form D filer is a business that raised private capital — but
  it is a real lane, not a dead one.
- **TheirStack replaced Adzuna** and returns size-verified SMBs. Adzuna is the
  one that produced nothing; TheirStack is the live source and it is the trigger
  lane worth investing in.

So the gap is NOT "we have no buying-window sources." It is that the sources we
have are not targeted at what we sell, and the signal they return is flattened
into one hardcoded shape before anything downstream can read it. Check a source's
own log line before writing it off.

The distinction the system does not make: **primary pain** is the ongoing condition
(thin reviews, no pricing, slow growth); **catalytic pain** is the event that puts
a clock on it. Every finding here is primary. An email about an ongoing condition
competes with the whole inbox; an email about something that changed last week does
not.

Largest gap. It is a Find-layer problem, not a copy problem.
