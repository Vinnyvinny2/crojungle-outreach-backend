## 8. Why every audit reads the same

`originalFindings` are the only thing that differs between two audits, and the
historical survival rate is ~11%. The corpus they are verified against was
`sitePages.rawText || trustedContent` — an **OR**, so the HOMEPAGE dropped out of
the corpus the moment any interior page was scraped. Five of the eight worked
examples in the prompt quote the homepage. A finding quoting their own homepage
tagline was therefore dropped as "does not appear on any page we read".

Mined review evidence is now in the corpus too: a review-derived finding was
being checked against web pages it could never appear on, which is a category
error rather than a threshold. Nothing is loosened — the rule is still "we hold
the words you are quoting".
