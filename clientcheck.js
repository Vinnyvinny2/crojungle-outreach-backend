// ══ THE CLIENT HAD NO AUTOMATED CHECK AT ALL ════════════════════════════════
// index.html is half this system — 10,000 lines of compiled React with no build
// step — and the only thing ever run against it was dupkeys.js. That found nine
// separate collisions in one function, each silently blanking data that had just
// loaded correctly, which is a fair indication of what else is in there.
//
// This checks the one thing that decides what the SERVER gets to work with: the
// research request. Two call sites build that request by hand, and on
// 2026-08-19 they disagreed about twenty fields — pressing "Run Research" sent
// neither the rating, the review count, the phone, the multi-market coverage nor
// the lead channel, while the discovery path sent all five and none of the
// browser measurements. Neither body was complete, and which audit you got
// depended on which button you pressed.
//
// That is the dominant bug class in this project stated exactly: a value that is
// computed in one place and never reaches the thing that consumes it.
//

// nothing at all — a check that cannot fail, which is the thing this project
// names as worse than no check.
//
// So it follows the builder: the keys are read from what buildResearchBody
// RETURNS, and a call site that hands researchViaQueue anything other than that
// builder is itself the failure, because a second hand-written body is exactly
// how the two came to disagree.
